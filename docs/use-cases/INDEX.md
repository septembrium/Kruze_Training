## Overview

This directory contains the structured use case documentation for the KRUZE Coffee & Tea Omnichannel Management System. Use cases are the permanent source of truth from which user stories, specs, and tasks are derived (see `AGENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md` §1.4).

### Actors

**Primary Actors** (people who initiate use cases):

| Actor | Interfaces |
|-------|-----------|
| **Admin** | Admin Dashboard |
| **POS User / Cashier** | POS Terminal |
| **Webshop Visitor** | Storefront |
| **Registered Customer** | Storefront, Loyalty App |

**Secondary Actors** (external systems or persons the system interacts with):

|-------|------|---------|
